# TomeRater
TomeRater project for Codecademy Programming With Python course

This project has completed the steps in the TomeRater exercise and made some additional enhancements in terms of error checkign and analytical methods.

Please note, some of the enhancements require more books to be added to users to function properly, as they are designed with a larger database in mind. Because we only submit the TomeRater.py, more books will have to be added manually by the assessor, but this should be fairly wuick using the built-in TomeRater methods.
